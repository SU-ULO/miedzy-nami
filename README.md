## History
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it was not possible for the school to organize its annual _Drzwi Otwarte_ in the traditional stationary fashion.
This game was created as a part of this online version of the event. 
The participants would connect to officialy hosted lobbies created by moderators consisting of the school's students. 
The main purpose of the game was to create a casual setting for conversation between the participants and the representatives of then current students, 
which would allow the former to ask questions about the school. 
Another reason for the creation of this game was to show the participants the possibilities of working on projects like this one, should they join the ranks of the students of the school.

The game was later slighlty revamped for its use at the 2022 _Drzwi Otwarte_.

## Features
- A lobby based multiplayer with the ability to create own lobbies
- A robust character customization system
- An extensible ingame task system (and over 20 tasks using it)
- Map layout loosely based on the layout of the _Uniwersyteckie Liceum Ogólnokształcące_ floorplan
- A game settings system enabling further personalization of the ingame experience
- A freeplay mode with bots for exploring the game without connecting to a lobby
